# AlphaFold Experiments

This repository contains experiments and notebooks for running protein structure predictions using AlphaFold2.

## Notebooks

*   **AlphaFold2.ipynb**: The main notebook for single sequence or complex prediction.
*   **Batch_AlphaFold2.ipynb**: A notebook designed for batch processing of multiple sequence files (CSV, FASTA, A3M) from a directory. It supports progress tracking and organized output.
